## Web based api explorer for developers

We took advantage of the awesome open source [dropbox api explorer](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-api-v2-explorer).
We have been using it internally for a few weeks to test the rinocloud api.

Its live now at [https://rinocloud.github.io/rinocloud-api-explorer/](https://rinocloud.github.io/rinocloud-api-explorer/)
