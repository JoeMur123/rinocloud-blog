<p>We looked at the research on the explosion of data and the challenges it was
causing. Then we went straight to researchers at the coal face and looked for
their opinions and feedback.   Through friends, colleagues, family we managed to
put together a pretty comprehensive email list of researchers/PhD student in
over 10 different colleges/research institutes around the world. The list had
physicists, biologists, chemists, water specialists, people working on gene
therapy…</p>

<p>We wrote an individual email to each telling them what we were up to and asking
them for help. First we asked them to fill in a simple 2 minute survey and
secondly if they were at all interested, would they mind giving up some of their
valuable time to test software for us.</p>

<p>80% people replied, including nearly 300 offering to test the software for us
because they said there was such a need. (Three people from this group ended up
working for us). Let’s share the results of the survey:</p>

<p>We asked how people currently managed their data storage. 80% used a combination
of Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive combined with local storage and USB
sticks.</p>

<p>We asked how people shared data with other team members. 82% said through
personal Dropbox files, through email and by sharing USB sticks.</p>

<p>We asked some questions about what lab automation software and what data
analytics software they were using AND how they configured this software to
manage data from their experiments. Over 90% of those surveyed used Labview,
Matlab, Pytnon, R, Origin, Excel. Of those 95% would have used drivers or
‘hacked’ the software in those applications to configure. Nearly all still had
to do some cutting and pasting or dragging and dropping to move data back and
forth from the storage system. Approx. 3% had coding skills and would have used
programming languages such as Python to try and seamlessly link between their
lab software and storage.</p>

<p>There’s a saying: you hear what you want to hear. We were hearing what we wanted
to hear from the survey because it all resonated with our own experiences and
provided justification for what we set out to build. So to get more of a reality
check we also interviewed 50 of the group surveyed. These interviews ranged from
10 minutes to 2 hours (as mentioned, three people started to work for us after
this because they were so passionate about what we were trying to do.) The
interviews convinced us that we were dealing with a real problem in the
scientific research community. The way data was being handled was not up to
scratch. Millions was being spent on the best lab equipment, the best lab
automation software to carry out the best experiments possible. But data
management was not keeping up. There is a smorgasbord of different ad hoc
approaches for storing, managing, sharing, searching scientific data. The
problem is hassle, time lost, inefficient use of resources. As more and more
data is produced the problems are getting worse. Well that’s what we’re telling
ourselves anyway and it’s what our friends and colleagues are experiencing…. And
our beta users are saying that Rinocloud is a gift that keeps on giving. Time
will tell!</p>
